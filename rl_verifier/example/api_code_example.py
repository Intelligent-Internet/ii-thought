You are given two integers **a** and **b**. Your task is to determine their sum.

### Input  

The first line contains an integer **a** (-10‚Åπ ‚â§ a ‚â§ 10‚Åπ).  
The second line contains an integer **b** (-10‚Åπ ‚â§ b ‚â§ 10‚Åπ).  

### Output  

Print a single integer ‚Äî the sum of **a** and **b**.  

### Examples  

#### Input  
```
3
5

#### Output  
```
8
